                  Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level
                  APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructur
                  e like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, 
                  backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, 
                  or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud 
                  operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale 
                  services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.

                  Public PaaS is derived from software as a service (SaaS),[16] and is situated in cloud computing between SaaS 
                  and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). SaaS is software hosted in the cloud, so that it does not take up 
                  hard drive space on the computers of users. IaaS provides virtual hardware from a provider with adjustable 
                  scalability. With IaaS, the user still has to manage the server, whereas with PaaS the server management 
                  is done by the provider.<br><br>
                
                  A communications platform as a service (CPaaS) is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to add 
                  real-time communications features (voice, video, and messaging) in their own applications without building 
                  back-end infrastructure and interfaces. Also, CPaaS and hardware and software specifications 
                  are specifically designed to support (tele)communications applications. These applications and their usage are 
                  much more sensitive to jitter, latency and packet losses. Hosted PABX, cellular networks, (near real time) 
                  applications typically are deployed on CPaaS platforms.

                   Software as a service  (also known as subscribeware or rentware) is a 
                  software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription 
                  basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and 
                  was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.<br><br>
                  SaaS applications are also known as Web-based software, on-demand software and hosted software.[3] The 
                  term "software as a service" (SaaS) is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing, along 
                  with infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), desktop as a service (DaaS),[4] managed 
                  software as a service (MSaaS), mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), datacenter as a service (DCaaS), and 
                  information technology management as a service (ITMaaS).
