                  Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level
                  APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructur
                  e like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, 
                  backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, 
                  or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud 
                  operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale 
                  services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.

               <p>Public, private and hybrid
                  There are several types of PaaS, including public, private and hybrid.[18] PaaS was originally 
                  intended for applications on public cloud services, before expanding to include private and 
                  hybrid options.[18]
                  Public PaaS is derived from software as a service (SaaS),[16] and is situated in cloud computing between SaaS 
                  and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).[1] SaaS is software hosted in the cloud, so that it does not take up 
                  hard drive space on the computers of users. IaaS provides virtual hardware from a provider with adjustable 
                  scalability.[1] With IaaS, the user still has to manage the server, whereas with PaaS the server management 
                  is done by the provider.[26]
                  A private PaaS can typically be downloaded and installed either in a company's on-premises data center, or in 
                  a public cloud. Once the software is installed on one or more machines, the private PaaS arranges the application 
                  and database components into a single hosting platform.[27]
                  Hybrid PaaS is typically a deployment consisting of a mix of public and private deployments.
                  Communications platform as a service
                  A communications platform as a service (CPaaS) is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to add 
                  real-time communications features (voice, video, and messaging) in their own applications without building 
                  back-end infrastructure and interfaces.[citation needed] Also, CPaaS and hardware and software specifications 
                  are specifically designed to support (tele)communications applications. These applications and their usage are 
                  much more sensitive to jitter, latency and packet losses. Hosted PABX, cellular networks, (near real time) 
                  applications typically are deployed on CPaaS platforms.
                  Mobile platform as a service
                  Initiated in 2012, mobile PaaS (mPaaS) provides development capabilities for mobile app designers and 
                  developers.[28] The Yankee Group identified mPaaS as one of its themes for 2014.[29][30]
                  Open PaaS
                  Open PaaS does not include hosting, but provides open source software allowing a PaaS provider to run 
                  applications in an open source environment, such as Google App Engine. Some open platforms let the developer 
                  use any programming language, database, operating system or server to deploy their applications.[31]

                   Software as a service (SaaS /s√¶s/[1]) (also known as subscribeware or rentware) is a 
                  software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription 
                  basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and 
                  was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.[2]
                  SaaS applications are also known as Web-based software, on-demand software and hosted software.[3] The 
                  term "software as a service" (SaaS) is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing, along 
                  with infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), desktop as a service (DaaS),[4] managed 
                  software as a service (MSaaS), mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), datacenter as a service (DCaaS), and 
                  information technology management as a service (ITMaaS).
                  SaaS apps are typically accessed by users using a thin client, e.g. via a web browser. SaaS has become a 
                  common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll 
                  processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, 
                  virtualization,[5] accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), management information 
                  systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), invoicing, human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition, 
                  learning management systems, content management (CM), geographic information systems (GIS), and service desk
                  management.[6] SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of nearly all leading enterprise software 
                  companies.[7][8]
                  According to a Gartner estimate, SaaS sales in 2018 were expected to grow 23% to $72 billion.[9]
